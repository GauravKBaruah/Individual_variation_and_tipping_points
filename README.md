## 01_Data

This folder contains data from the simulations as well as the empirical data.
For the empirical data see **Network data**.

## 02_Simulation_codes

This folder contains two R scripts. One is `02_functions_tipping_point.R` that contains all the functions for running the eco-evolutionary simulations. The other is the code that runs all the simulations `01_tipping_point_sims.R`. 


## 03_Analysis

This folder contains two R scripts. First R script `02_analysis_species_tipping_point.R` that analyses the eco-evolutionary simulated data and the `fesibility_analysis.R` that analysis the feasibility data.
